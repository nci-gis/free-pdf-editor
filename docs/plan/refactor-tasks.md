# Refactor Tasks for Static Web-App PDF Editor

## Task List

1. **Audit Svelte components**
    - Review all Svelte components in `src/` for code duplication, tight coupling, and server-side dependencies. Identify dynamic imports and plan for removal.

2. **Check asset references**
    - Verify all asset references in `public/index.html` are local and remove any external dependencies.

3. **Refactor components**
    - Split large Svelte components into smaller, reusable modules (toolbar, canvas, PDF controls). Standardize props, events, and state management.

4. **Organize project structure**
    - Restructure `src/` into logical folders (`components/`, `utils/`, `assets/`). Remove unused files and redundant dependencies from `package.json`. Update import paths.

5. **Migrate to pnpm**
    - Replace npm with pnpm for package management. Remove `package-lock.json`, generate `pnpm-lock.yaml`, and update documentation/CI scripts.

6. **Upgrade dependencies**
    - Audit and upgrade all dependencies in `package.json` to their latest compatible versions. Test and update code for breaking changes.

7. **Move and document utilities**
    - Move utility functions from `src/utils/` into well-named modules and add documentation for usage.

8. **Configure build pipeline**
    - Update Rollup config to bundle all JS/CSS for static deployment. Ensure all dependencies are included in the final bundle and optimize asset loading in `public/index.html`.

9. **Test static deployment**
    - Open `public/index.html` directly in Chrome/Edge and validate full functionality. Remove any Node.js/server environment code.

10. **Update documentation**
    - Update `readme.md` for new structure and static deployment instructions. Document refactored modules in `docs/`.

11. **Run quality checks**
    - Run linting and formatting tools. Add basic unit tests for core utilities and components. Perform manual regression testing.
